## Describe your project
SDU ChatBot - is a student help system that can answer any question you may have about stydying at SDU. The main users of this chat room are students and applicants. Applicants can learn about the necessary documents for admission, the cost of study, faculties and specialties, and what conditions must be met when studying for grant holders and who are going to study on a fee basis.Students who are already enrolled can learn basic information about their studies, student life, where you can read about the policy, and get information about their 4 offices, as well as student service center and student house.

I have collected brief information, which I think is the most necessary for students and applicants, but I have also left a link to our website, where they can read the full information in detail
